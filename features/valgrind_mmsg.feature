# Required Cargo features (vary per scenario — see inline comments):
#   lidi-send:    command-line, from-tcp, and one of: send-native, send-msg, send-mmsg
#   lidi-receive: command-line, to-tcp, and one of: receive-native, receive-msg, receive-mmsg
#   lidi-clients: tcp
#
# Unsafe code covered by this feature (the only unsafe outside lidi-bindings):
#
#   lidi-send/src/socket.rs (send-msg and send-mmsg modes only):
#     mem::zeroed::<libc::iovec>()         — zero-initialise iovec before use
#     mem::zeroed::<libc::mmsghdr>()       — zero-initialise mmsghdr before use  [mmsg only]
#     &raw mut iovecs[i] in msg_hdr.msg_iov — raw pointer into a pinned Vec       [mmsg only]
#     datagram.as_mut_ptr() in iov_base    — raw pointer into an owned Vec<u8>
#     libc::sendmsg()                      — single-datagram syscall              [msg only]
#     libc::sendmmsg()                     — batch-datagram syscall               [mmsg only]
#
#   lidi-receive/src/socket.rs (receive-msg and receive-mmsg modes only):
#     mem::zeroed::<libc::iovec>()         — zero-initialise iovec before use
#     mem::zeroed::<libc::mmsghdr>()       — zero-initialise mmsghdr before use  [mmsg only]
#     &raw mut iovecs[i] in msg_hdr.msg_iov — raw pointer into a pinned Vec       [mmsg only]
#     buffer.as_mut_ptr() in iov_base      — raw pointer into a pinned Vec<u8>
#     libc::recvmsg()                      — single-datagram syscall              [msg only]
#     libc::recvmmsg() with MSG_WAITFORONE — batch-datagram syscall               [mmsg only]
#     *libc::__errno_location()            — errno read in error path
#     &self.buffers[0..nb_msg][i][0..msg_len] — slice bounded by kernel-written msg_len
#
#   Not covered here:
#     lidi-command-utils/src/socket.rs     — getsockopt/setsockopt/mem::transmute
#                                            (socket helpers, exercised in every test)
#     lidi-clients/src/bin/lidi-file-receive.rs — libc::chroot() (filesystem isolation,
#                                            unrelated to the UDP transport)
#
# Valgrind invocation (implemented by the step):
#   valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all \
#            --track-origins=yes --error-exitcode=1
#
# Timeouts are set to 4× normal to account for Valgrind instrumentation overhead.
# The diode is throttled at 10mbit; Valgrind slows CPU-bound processing, not
# the loopback link itself, so effective throughput drops ~10–20×.

Feature: Valgrind memcheck on unsafe UDP socket implementation (msg and mmsg)

  # send=mmsg, recv=native — isolates the send side

  # send=mmsg, recv=mmsg, large transfer — exercises repeated reuse of the
  # pinned iovec/mmsghdr arrays across many consecutive RaptorQ blocks.
  # At block=20000 B and MTU=1500 each block produces ~16 packets, so a
  # 10 MB file generates ~600 blocks → ~600 sendmmsg() calls and a
  # matching number of recvmmsg() calls, each reusing the same 1024-entry
  # iovec and mmsghdr arrays.
  # Validates: no use-after-free or stale iov_base pointer across repeated
  # calls; correct re-initialisation of msg_len before each sendmmsg call.
